  The Student Data app allows users to add, delete, and update student information in a convenient and user-friendly manner.

When adding student data, users are prompted to enter relevant information such as the student's name, age, gender, grade level, and contact details. Once entered, this information is saved and stored in the app's database.

To delete student data, users can simply select the student they wish to remove from the list and confirm the deletion. The app will then automatically remove the selected student's information from the database.

Updating student data is made easy through the app's intuitive interface. Users can select a specific student from the list, edit any desired information, and save the changes. The app will automatically update the corresponding student's details in the database.

Overall, the Student Data app simplifies the process of managing, organizing, and maintaining student information. With its ability to add, delete, and update student data, it provides a comprehensive solution for educational institutions and individuals to efficiently handle student records.
